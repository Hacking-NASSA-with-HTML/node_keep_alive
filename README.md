# node_keep_alive

#### Solution to the problem:

Hey guys:wave:!

There is a challenge:mechanic:!

That app is hosted on Render.

And that hoster has a peculiarity:

after 15-20 minutes of server's inactivity the images are disappearing, because server is 

going into a sleep mode, and images are keeping in temp folder.

So if someone has a script the server ping itself every 10 minutes it would be Very 

Appreciated:heart:.

Or recommend some good educational tutorial how to encode images directly into MongoDB.

## The challenge is Solved:raising_hand:!

That's amazing, guys!

That's REALLY amazing😎!

Four servers are spinning simultaneously!

Again! FOUR servers, guys!!!

One server is on Railway, to ping that Second one on Render with Back-End, -

"Do not sleep lazy azz"😂!

The Third one keeps the Database.

And the Fourth one is spinning a Front-End!

Four servers to run one app!

Unbelievable! Just Unbelievable!

The Microverse community is Sooo Inspiring🎆!!!

Thank you, guys! You are amazing❤️!

May Your Code Always Works Too :champagne::clinking_glasses:
